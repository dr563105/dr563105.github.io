# Introduction

**Change Data Capture**(CDC) is a mechanism in which every change committed to a row in a table is captured and sent to downstream applications. This CDC post answers some of the questions:

> How to transfer change data from source database downstream through Kafka?

> How does Debezium help with CDC?

> How to ingest data from Kafka topics into a warehouse for analytics?

We will use a simple CDC project to explore the data pipeline to get data from upstream to downstream consumers.

**Full disclosure** - this post and project is inspired from Start Data Engineering's [blog post](https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/change-data-capture-using-debezium-kafka-and-pg/). I highly recommend reading his posts. It is highly informative. Although, I use his template, the data, data pipeline setup, this blog post are entirely my work.

# What is CDC and why is it needed?

CDC is a process of capturing all the data changes from source in the upstream and send it to consumers/applications in the downstream. The sources are usually databases and sinks/consumers/applications are data warehouses for analytics, another database for backup, caches.

One of the main reasons of using CDC is to have minimal impact whilst migrating data between databases. Through continuous data change stream it is possible to quickly and efficiently forward data to downstream applications.

In this post we will use the **log** method of capturing change from the source system using `Debezium`.

### Capture change from source system

As the source systems are usually databases, we use their logs to CDC. Postgres has **Write Ahead Log**(WAL) and MYSQL **Binlog**. More on WAL later.

### Making changes available to consumers

Usually there are two options available to forward captured change data to downstream applications:

i. Use a shared location such as S3, Kafka.
ii. Directly load the change data into a consumer system.

We will explore option 2 as our data throughput is smaller.

# Project

## Objective
Observe and monitor a postgres DB source with a schema `commerce` and tables `users` and `products`. When there is a change in their rows, we will capture those, send it downstream through Apache Kafka and make it available for analytics through `duckDB`.

Before I begin explaining the project's data pipeline in detail, let me quickly give you the steps to reproduce it. This way you can get started already and read the details later.

## Challenges faced
If you're curious like me, it is always the challenges that make a good story to tell others. Instead of going in length about each challenge, I will just list a few that I found harder.

- Figuring out why decimal/numeric data type variables from source don't reach the destination with same values. I went from source to sink to Kafka to Debezium to finally discover that it is an issue with Debezium Kafka Connect.

- Understanding various configurations for Apache Kafka and which ones are needed while starting its Docker container.

- Learning how WAL works and the significance of CDC

## Architecture

![](cdc-pipeline.png){width=300%}

## Prerequisites and Setup

We use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS AWS EC2 machine for the project. Full source code [here](https://github.com/dr563105/cdc-pg-dbz-kafka-s3.git).

We need the following:

- [git version >= 2.37.1](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git),

- [Docker version >= 20.10.17](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker compose v2 version >= v2.10.2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/),

- [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/install),

- [make](https://linuxhint.com/install-make-ubuntu/),
<!-- - AWS account and [awscli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) -->
- optional, python >= v3.7.

To make things easier I have scripted these prerequisites. Just clone my repo and run the instructions I provide.

```{.bash filename="clone and install prerequisites"}
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git make -y
git clone 
cd cdc-pg-dbz-kafka-s3
make install_conda # <1> 
make install_docker # <2>
source ~/.bashrc
```
1. Installs Miniconda. Optional but recommended.
2. Installs Docker and Docker-compose.

Logout and log in back to the instance. To test docker if it is working, run

```{.bash filename="check if docker is installed"}
docker run --rm hello-world # should return "Hello from Docker!" without errors
```

Now we're ready to execute our project. I highly encourage readers to use `makefile` as it makes setup highly efficient.

```{.bash filename="Executing CDC project"}
cd cdc-pg-dbz-kafka-s3
export POSTGRES_USER=postgres
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
export POSTGRES_DB=cdc-demo-db
export POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
export AWS_KEY_ID=minio
export AWS_SECRET_KEY=minio123
export AWS_BUCKET_NAME=commerce
make up # runs all docker containers
#wait for 60 seconds allow all containers to be up and running
make connections # setup connectors
#wait for 100-120 seconds to allow data to be pushed to Minio(S3).
```
Open a browser and go to `localhost:9001` to open up `Minio UI`. Login with `minio` as username and `minio123` as password. Then navigate to `buckets` -> `commerce` -> `debezium.commerce.products` and further to get to the `json` files. Similarly to reach `debezium.commerce.users` table `json` files.

These `json` files contain the change data(Upsert and delete) for respective tables. From here we can use `duckdb` to analyse data. There you have it,  a complete data pipeline that fetches change data from the source and brings it to the sink(downstream).

### Deleting resources
To bring down all container and return to the original state, run the following instructions

```{.bash filename="restoring to original state"}
make down #shuts down all project processes and docker containers
# To delete minio buckets with json files and DB volume. 
# Docker creates directories with root as owner. 
# So root access is needed to delete them.
# sudo rm -rf minio/ psql_vol/
```

# Data Pipeline detailed explanation
:::{.callout-warning}
Each section contains code and sufficient explanation. Therefore, it is long. I advise giving an overview before coming back for a thourough read.
:::

We will setup each component in the data pipeline individually and use Debezium Kafka Connect to connect them.

## Loading data into Postgres DB source

We leverage Postgres docker bootstrap feature to create our table and set permissions for replication. For more on bootstrap feature, go this [link](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres), navigate to `Initialization scripts`.

In our case we have a file `init.sql` mounted to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

```{.sql filename="init.sql"}
-- create schema commerce
CREATE SCHEMA commerce;

-- Use commerce schema
SET search_path TO commerce;

-- create a users table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email_address TEXT NOT NULL 
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
   name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   description TEXT,
   price REAL NOT NULL -- <1>
);

ALTER TABLE users REPLICA IDENTITY FULL; -- <2>

ALTER TABLE products REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```
1. The price has to be REAL data type as debezium encodes NUMERIC or DECIMAL data types to BigDecimal Binary. For more on that, read [here](https://debezium.io/documentation/faq/#how_to_retrieve_decimal_field_from_binary_representation).
2. To allow for replication. Records the old values of all columns in the row in the WAL.

### WAL - Write Ahead Log
A Write-Ahead log is a feature especially in Databases to ensure integrity of data and durability in case of system failure. It is a process of recording changes in sequential `logs` before writing directly into disk(Databases).

Our intended changes are first written to the log and then passed onto DB. Upon successful transaction, the log is updated with a sequence number. Upon system failure and consective restart, the DB polls the log to resume its operation. This way systems can acheive ACID properties for reliable and robust database management.

The SQL command `ALTER TABLE users REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;` instructs Postgres to use all columns of the users table to identify rows when replicating changes. 

### Generating data for upload

We use `faker` python library to generate fake data into the tables - users and products. We use the `psycopg2` Postgres python library to establish database(DB) connection. And then use it to commit the generated data.

```{.python filename="user_product_data.py"}
conn = psycopg2.connect(database=f'{POSTGRES_DB}',
                        user=f'{POSTGRES_USER}',
                        password=f'{POSTGRES_PASSWORD}',
                        host=f'{POSTGRES_HOSTNAME}'
                       )

curr = conn.cursor()
curr.execute(f"INSERT INTO \
               commerce.users (id, username, email_address) \
               VALUES (%s, %s, %s)", (id, fake.user_name(), fake.email())
            )
curr.execute(f"INSERT INTO \
               commerce.products (id, name, description, price) \
               VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)", (id, fake.name(), fake.text(), 
               (fake.random_int(min=1, max=999_999))/100.0)
      )
conn.commit()
```

We can use the same script to simulate(with `sleep`) updating and deleting a few rows at random. 

```{.python filename="user_product_data.py"}
sleep(0.3) # <1>
# update 10 % of the time
if random.randint(1, 100) >= 90:
  curr.execute("UPDATE commerce.users \
                SET username = %s\
                WHERE id = %s",(fake.user_name(), id)
              )
  curr.execute("UPDATE commerce.products \
                SET name = %s \
                WHERE id = %s",(fake.user_name(), id)
              )
  conn.commit()

sleep(0.4)
# delete 5 % of the time
if random.randint(1, 100) >= 95:
  curr.execute("DELETE FROM commerce.users WHERE id = %s",(id,))
  curr.execute("DELETE FROM commerce.products WHERE id = %s", (id,))

conn.commit()
curr.close()
```
1. `sleep` allows for data to be inserted and be ready sequential operations.

### Associated Docker configuration

```{.yaml filename="docker-compose.yml for data upload into source DB"}
cdc_commerce_postgres:
    container_name: source-db
    image: debezium/postgres:13-alpine
    hostname: ${POSTGRES_HOST} # <1>
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER} # <1>
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD} # <1>
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB} # <1>
    volumes:
      - "./postgres/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql" # <2>
      - "./psql_vol:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw"
    networks:
      - my_network

  datagen:
    build: ./generate-data
    container_name: datagen
    restart: on-failure
    environment: # <3>
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
      POSTGRES_HOST: ${POSTGRES_HOST}
    depends_on:
      - cdc_commerce_postgres # <4>
    networks:
      - my_network
```
1. Environment variables to spin up a Postgres DB server is supplied from the terminal. 
2. Utilising Postgres bootstrap feature we can create our schema, define and create tables.
3. For `datagen` container DB env variables are supplied. The `user_product_data.py` uses these variables to populate the tables.
4. Ofcourse, to populate the tables, source DB must be ready. `depends_on` property defines the dependency between two services.

Now our source DB is populated. 

## Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is a message stream processing framework. The change data from the source DB must be streamed downstream. Kafka facilitates this process. 

Kafka uses a meta-data service management tool called `Zookeeper`. It handles the configurations needed for Kafka brokers to perform their tasks properly.

Using docker properties, we invoke `kafka` and `zookeeper` services. 

```{.yaml filename="docker-compose config for Zookeeper and Kafka"}
zookeeper:
    image: debezium/zookeeper:2.4
    container_name: zookeeper
    ports:
      - "2181:2181" # <1>
    networks:
      - my_network
    
  kafka:
    container_name: kafka
    image: debezium/kafka:latest
    ports:
      - "9093:9093" 
    environment:
      - ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:2181 # <2>
      - KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME=LISTENER_INT # <3>
      - KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP=LISTENER_INT:PLAINTEXT,LISTENER_EXT:PLAINTEXT # <4>
      - KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=LISTENER_INT://kafka:9092,LISTENER_EXT://localhost:9093 # <5>
      - KAFKA_LISTENERS=LISTENER_INT://0.0.0.0:9092,LISTENER_EXT://0.0.0.0:9093 # <6>
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    networks:
      - my_network
```
1. Zookeeper utilises port `2181` for its service.
2. Kafka communicates with zookeeper through `2181` port.
3. Internal broker listener name definition.
4. Definition of security protocol between listener names and their protocols. Here it is just plain text.
5. Internally Kafka brokers communicate with themselves using `9092`. They also communicate with port `9093` since it is mapped. 
6. `kafka.listeners` property is redundant here as it same as the previous line. But the consumers reading from Kafka can use port `9093` also.

Apache Kafka configuration can be confusing. It is advised to start simple and add in as needs demand.

Next, up is to setup the sink or the final destination. 

## Storage - Minio S3
We want to store our message streams from Kafka into a storage as files. We utlise `Minio` an object storage service as it mimics AWS S3.

To set it up, as usual we configure its properties through docker-compose.

```{.yaml filename="docker-compose for Minio storage"}
minio:
    image: minio/minio:RELEASE.2022-05-26T05-48-41Z
    hostname: minio
    container_name: minio
    ports:
      - '9000:9000' 
      - '9001:9001'
    volumes:
      - "./minio/data:/data" # <1>
    environment:
      MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: ${AWS_KEY_ID}  # <2>
      MINIO_SECRET_KEY: ${AWS_SECRET_KEY} # <2>
```
1. `minio` directory is created and it is mounted as volume.
2. To mimic AWS S3, we can pass credentials as env variables.

There is another service that creates buckets inside the mounted volume. I leave that to the reader as a self-exercise.

## Debezium Kafka Connect

All the individual blocks are now prepared, and the remaining task is to connect them.

Setting up Debezium involves two parts:

- Connect to Source DB

- Connect Kafka topics to Minio S3 storage

Debezium supports Postgres source using Kafka connect natively but as a sink connector to S3 it lacks functionality. So we borrow Kafka connect, add in a plugin that recognises both Kafka topics and S3 storage. 

There are several services which offers sink connectors but for simplicity sake, I use an open source service in [Aiven](https://docs.aiven.io/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/reference/s3-sink-additional-parameters). 

So, with the help of `docker-compose`, we use `debezium/connect` docker image and install [`Aiven` S3 connector plugin](https://github.com/Aiven-Open/s3-connector-for-apache-kafka) on top of it. 

```{.yaml filename="docker-compose for Debezium connect"}
  debezium-connect:
    container_name: debezium-connect
    build: ./sink-connector # <1>
    ports:
      - "8083:8083"
    environment:
      - BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=kafka:9092 # <2>
      - GROUP_ID=1
      - CONFIG_STORAGE_TOPIC=my_connect_configs
      - OFFSET_STORAGE_TOPIC=my_connect_offsets
      - STATUS_STORAGE_TOPIC=my_connect_statuses
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
      - kafka
    networks:
      - my_network
```
1. Installs Aiven S3 connector plugin.
2. Debezium connects to Kafka as a producer and Aiven S3 Kafka Connect monitors Kafka topics as a consumer.

:::{.callout-important}
The Debezium(`producer`) connector still doesn't know from where it is fetching the data from or the Aiven Connect(`consumer`) sending the data to. 
:::

## Activating the traffic in the pipeline

To activate the traffic flow from source to destination, we need to supply source and destination link configurations.  This is acheived through `json` connector configuration.

Apache Kafka uses `REST API` so that means a JSON data goes into the body of the POST request.
Conveniently there is `curl` command that can be used to request. Though `curl` commands allows to pass `json` files to the `data` option, the `JSON` format as such require sensitive information properties to be hard-coded. That puts system security at risk.

Fortunately for us, a shell script allows for sensitive information to be masked while being supplied at run time(more on it [here](https://dr563105.github.io/posts/2023-08-30-secrets-in-json/)). It is indeed that approach we take for our task to connect the blocks in the pipeline.

```{.bash filename="setup-connections.sh"}
curl --include --request POST --header "Accept:application/json" \
    --header "Content-Type:application/json" \
    --url localhost:8083/connectors/ \
    --data '{    
        "name": "pg-src-connector",
        "config": {
            "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector", # <1>
            "tasks.max": "1",
            "database.hostname": "'"${POSTGRES_USER}"'", # <2>
            "database.port": "5432",
            "database.user": "'"${POSTGRES_USER}"'",
            "database.password": "'"${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}"'",
            "database.dbname": "'"${POSTGRES_DB}"'",
            "database.server.name": "postgres",
            "database.include.list": "postgres",
            "topic.prefix": "debezium", # <3>
            "schema.include.list": "commerce", # <3>
            "decimal.handling.mode": "precise" # <4>
        }
      }'
```
1. Debezium connector standards.
2. Supplying env variables to the properties
3. Usually Kafka topic names are just table names. So in our case, it will be `debezium.commerce.products` and `debezium.commerce.users`.
4. This property can adjusted to `double` preserve source's decimal or numeric data types.

Similarly we can setup sink connector.

```{.bash filename="setup-connections.sh"}
curl --include --request POST --header "Accept:application/json" \
    --header "Content-Type:application/json" \
    --url localhost:8083/connectors/ \
    --data '{
        "name": "s3-sink",
        "config": {
            "connector.class": "io.aiven.kafka.connect.s3.AivenKafkaConnectS3SinkConnector",
            "aws.access.key.id": "'"${AWS_KEY_ID}"'",
            "aws.secret.access.key": "'"${AWS_SECRET_KEY}"'",
            "aws.s3.bucket.name": "'"${AWS_BUCKET_NAME}"'",
            "aws.s3.endpoint": "http://minio:9000",
            "aws.s3.region": "us-east-1",
            "format.output.type": "jsonl",
            "topics": "debezium.commerce.users,debezium.commerce.products", # <1>
            "file.compression.type": "none",
            "flush.size": "20",
            "file.name.template": "/{{topic}}/{{timestamp:unit=yyyy}}-{{timestamp:unit=MM}}-{{timestamp:unit=dd}}/{{timestamp:unit=HH}}/{{partition:padding=true}}-{{start_offset:padding=true}}.json" # <2>
        }
    }'
```
1. Sink connector actively listens to these topics to receive data.
2. File generated have templated filename.

## Deployment
To deploy all the components we can use these commands
```{.bash filename="setup data pipeline"}
make up # <1>
make connections # <2>
```
1. Fires up all the services.
2. Links source to Kafka and Kafka topics to Minio S3.

![](scr-make-up.png)

On successful connection establishment, we will `201 created` message as shown in the below screenshot.

![](scr-make-connections.png)

If done correctly, we should have successfully connected the source to the destination. 
We will wait a few minutes to have the files appear in the Minio `commerce` bucket.

![](scr-commerce-json.png)

We can also use the Minio UI available at `localhost:9001`. Use the Minio's credentials supplied as env variables to login.

## Analysis
The next part would be to use an analytics DB as such as `DuckDB` to perform analytics. 
A sample query that can used to generate `SCD2` table.

```{.sql filename="analysis.sql"}
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        COALESCE(CAST(json->'value'->'after'->>'id' AS INTEGER), CAST(json->'value'->'before'->>'id' AS INTEGER)) AS id,
        json->'value'->>'before' AS before_row_value,
        json->'value'->>'after' AS after_row_value,
        CASE
            WHEN json->'value'->>'op' = 'c' THEN 'CREATE'
            WHEN json->'value'->>'op' = 'd' THEN 'DELETE'
            WHEN json->'value'->>'op' = 'u' THEN 'UPDATE'
            WHEN json->'value'->>'op' = 'r' THEN 'SNAPSHOT'
            ELSE 'INVALID'
        END AS operation_type,
        json->'value'->'source'->>'lsn' AS log_seq_num,
        epoch_ms(CAST(json->'value'->'source'->>'ts_ms' AS BIGINT)) AS source_timestamp
    FROM
        read_ndjson_objects('minio/data/commerce/debezium.commerce.products/*/*/*.json')
    WHERE log_seq_num IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
    id,
    CAST(after_row_value->>'name' AS VARCHAR(255)) AS name,
    CAST(after_row_value->>'description' AS TEXT) AS description,
    CAST(after_row_value->>'price' AS NUMERIC(10, 2)) AS price,
    source_timestamp AS row_valid_start_timestamp,
    CASE 
        WHEN LEAD(source_timestamp, 1) OVER w_lead_txn_timestamp IS NULL THEN CAST('9999-01-01' AS TIMESTAMP) 
        ELSE LEAD(source_timestamp, 1) OVER w_lead_txn_timestamp 
    END AS row_valid_expiration_timestamp
FROM cte
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM cte GROUP BY id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
WINDOW w_lead_txn_timestamp AS (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY log_seq_num)
ORDER BY id, row_valid_start_timestamp
LIMIT 20;
```

Making SCD2 table is out of scope for this project but no worries I will go through it another post.

# Conclusion

In this post, we saw a simple project that explore the advantages of change data capture using Debezium and Kafka Connect and its implementation. I hope you found it as informative as I found it while developing the project. As always please feel free to contact me on the links provided. I would love to hear your comments.
